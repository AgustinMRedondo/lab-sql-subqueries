-- 1. Determine the number of copies of the film "Hunchback Impossible" that exist in the inventory system.

SELECT
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM inventory
     WHERE film_id = (SELECT film_id FROM film 
     WHERE title = 'Hunchback Impossible')
    ) AS number_of_copies;

-- 2. List all films whose length is longer than the average length of all the films in the Sakila database.
SELECT title, length FROM film
  WHERE
    length > (SELECT AVG(length) FROM film) ORDER BY length;

-- 3. Use a subquery to display all actors who appear in the film "Alone Trip".

SELECT first_name FROM actor
    WHERE actor_id IN (SELECT actor_id FROM film_actor 
    WHERE film_id = (SELECT film_id from film 
    WHERE title = "Alone Trip"));

-- 4. Sales have been lagging among young families, and you want to target family movies for a promotion. Identify all movies categorized as family films. 
SELECT title FROM film
    WHERE film_id IN (SELECT film_id FROM film_category 
    WHERE category_id = (SELECT category_id FROM category 
    WHERE name= "family"));

-- 5. Retrieve the name and email of customers from Canada using both subqueries and joins. To use joins, you will need to identify the relevant tables and their primary and foreign keys.

--SUBQUERY
SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM customer
    WHERE address_id IN (SELECT address_id FROM address
    WHERE city_id IN (SELECT city_id FROM city
    WHERE country_id IN (SELECT country_id FROM country
    WHERE country = "Canada")));

-- JOIN
SELECT first_name, last_name, email, country.country  FROM customer
JOIN address 
USING (address_id)
JOIN city 
USING (city_id)
JOIN country 
USING (country_id)
WHERE country = "Canada";

-- 6. Determine which films were starred by the most prolific actor in the Sakila database. A prolific actor is defined as the actor who has acted in the most number of films. First, you will need to find the most prolific actor and then use that actor_id to find the different films that he or she starred in.
SELECT title FROM film
    WHERE 
    film_id IN ( SELECT film_id FROM film_actor
        WHERE actor_id = (SELECT actor_id FROM (SELECT actor_id, COUNT(*) AS film_count FROM film_actor GROUP BY actor_id ORDER BY film_count DESC LIMIT 1)
         AS prolific_actor
    )
);

-- 7. Find the films rented by the most profitable customer in the Sakila database. You can use the customer and payment tables to find the most profitable customer, i.e., the customer who has made the largest sum of payments.
SELECT title FROM film
    WHERE film_id IN (SELECT inventory.film_id  FROM inventory
    WHERE inventory.inventory_id IN (SELECT rental.inventory_id FROM rental
    WHERE rental.customer_id = (SELECT customer_id
                FROM (SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_payment
                FROM payment  GROUP BY customer_id ORDER BY total_payment DESC LIMIT 1) 
                AS most_profitable_customer
        )
    )
);
    
-- 8. Retrieve the client_id and the total_amount_spent of those clients who spent more than the average of the total_amount spent by each client. You can use subqueries to accomplish this.

SELECT customer_id, total_amount_spent
FROM (
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_amount_spent FROM payment GROUP BY customer_id
) AS customer_spending
    WHERE total_amount_spent > (SELECT AVG(total_amount_spent)
    FROM (
        SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_amount_spent
        FROM payment
        GROUP BY customer_id
    ) AS avg_spending
);
